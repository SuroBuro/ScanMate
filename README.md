# ScanMate
A Hobby application which would let me clean up and scanlate manga

## Dependencies
***
- OpenCV

## What is the need of this project?
Not much, i just wanted to experience automating cleanup for manga pages

## Any future plans?
I plan to make it a lightweight alternative to PanelCleaner, with a standalone application with a GUI
