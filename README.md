# ScanMate
A lightweight Tkinter based [PanelCleaner](https://github.com/VoxelCubes/PanelCleaner) alternative.

The app lets you load pictures, and preview pictures. It also allows you to keep text selections which you might deem to be a false positive

## Dependencies
***
- OpenCV
- EasyOCR
- Numpy
- PIL
- tkinter
  

## What is the need of this project?
A friend of mine was getting his hands dirty with the entire scanlation scene. He had a slight complaint about PanelCleaner, his potato came to a screeching halt everytime he used the app. So, this is a modest attempt at solving a friend's problems, hopefully I find the motivation enough to keep this ongoing as a project

## Any future plans?
As I managed to attempt the small road sign I had planted last time, I would plant another one farther away!
I would try to make it so that
- UI/UX is more readable and stylised
- You can manually resize the bounding boxes of the texts detected
- You can create your own boxes for manually removing texts, artifacts
